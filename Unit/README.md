# Unit Testing

Tests in this directory are targeted to specific parts in the code,
such as a particular updater.

## Rules

- Untested code is not deemed to exist. Hence no credit can be had for
  code which lacks tests.

- All code shall be (a) comprehensible, (b) tested with regression
  and/or unit tests, and (c) used *somewhere*.
